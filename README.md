# invisible-research

This repository hosts computational work including scientometric analysis on scholarly knowledge staying invisible in a biased academic ecosystem, conducted in collaboration with the Public Knowledge Project, the Scholarly Communication Lab, and University of Oxford. Our initial work analyzed journals ([now 58000+](https://rpubs.com/saurabh90/ojs-stats-2024)) largely absent from common journal counts, as well as Web of Science and Scopus, demonstrating that scholarly communication is more of a global endeavor than is commonly credited. These journals, employing the open-source publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have published 5.8 million+ research articles in 136 countries, with 79.9% in the Global South and 84.2% following the OA diamond model (charging neither reader nor author). A substantial proportion of journals operate in more than one language (48.3%), with research published in 60 languages (led by English, Indonesian, Spanish, and Portuguese). The journals are distributed across the social sciences (45.9%), STEM (40.3%), and the humanities (13.8%). For all their geographic, linguistic, and disciplinary diversity, 1.2% are indexed in the Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus. On the other hand, 1.0% are found in Cabell’s Predatory Reports, and 1.4% show up in Beall’s (2021) questionable list. This research seeks to both contribute to and historically situate the expanded scale and diversity of scholarly publishing in the hope that this recognition may assist humankind in taking full advantage of what is increasingly a global research enterprise.
